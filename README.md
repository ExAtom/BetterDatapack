# Better Datapack for Minecraft
Same datapacks. Better execution.

# Features
Here are all the features it gives. The Config file is necessary!

## Config
Create a `bdconfig.json` file in the root folder of you Datapack. Add an `output-path` object and paste an absolute path pointing where you want the pack to be outputted and what foldername.

## Multiline commands (1.0.0)
You no longer need to cram long complex commands in a single line. However you will need to use slashes at the start of every single one.
